# Simulated IFRS 17 Solution Pipeline

This repository provides a Python-based simulation pipeline for implementing an International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 17 solution. It uses synthetic data to model insurance policy cash flows, calculate liabilities, and visualize financial metrics. The solution is designed to be a comprehensive framework for understanding IFRS 17 concepts and testing actuarial models.

## Features

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates realistic insurance policy data, including premiums, claims, and various expenses.
- **Cash Flow Modeling**: Calculates present value for premiums, claims, and directly attributable expenses.
- **Contractual Service Margin (CSM)**: Computes the unearned profit for an insurance contract.
- **Risk Adjustment Calculation**: Provides a simplified approach to calculate risk adjustments over the coverage period.
- **Liability Modeling**: Computes total liabilities by combining cash flows, risk adjustments, and CSM.
- **Financial Reporting**: Summarizes key metrics for financial reporting.
- **Visualization**: Includes histograms and other visual tools to analyze the distribution of liabilities.
